Gluon Applications are Java application written in JavaFX.
These applications ensure that developers can create high performance, great looking, and cloud connected mobile apps from a single Java code base.

This sample contains a simple Gluon application which can be used to run, test and create a native application for any targeted device.
The sample contains views represented as FXML and accessed in JavaFX using Controllers.
For more information on FXML and why to use them, checkout this [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/fxml-tutorial/why_use_fxml.htm).
